# LTP
Code for the course Language Technology Project, taught at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Groningen.

For this research we used the Political Speech Project database (https://rania.shinyapps.io/PoliticalSpeechProject/), which we are not allowed to share.

The code in this repository is based on assignment 4 from the course Language Technology Project. We also used the libraries huggingface, PyTorch and sci-kit learn.
